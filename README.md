# anilist-data-exploration
Hello Everyone,

Not unlike a lot of people, I spent a lot of my quarantine starting in 2020 checking out this interesting art form known as Anime and i fell in love. Something about the art, plots and storylines drew me all the way in. At some point towards the middle of 2021, I started having some questions regarding the data i was looking at on Anilist about some of the shows and wanted to look through them. I was also interested on a data project or two, so when I came across the AniList API it felt like the project I had been looking for. 
After some months of inconsistently working with the API and then Python and PostgreSQL, I was able to finagle the data into some usable ways, starting with the heatmap. I hope to do some more graphs sooner than later, but until then enjoy the heatmap and its work book and data.
